		<h2 class="intro-2">This is my story</h2>
	<p>My name is Lincoln Ajanga and I am a Moringa Prep student.
	eagerly waiting to enroll in the core program.</p>
	<p>I am also in my mid 20s and taking life easy. I love sports especially rugby and chess.
	My dream and what drives me every since day is to perfect my programmig skills so that one day I may be able to come up with something worthwhile that benefits me and also the comunity at large.
	Programming is <strong class="ace">not</strong> just about writing a bunch of fancy codes rather getting things done by applying it in solving problems that people face every single day. And thats basically who I am...a problem solver!</p>
